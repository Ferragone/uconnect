Genetic Algorithm for Maximizing a Multivariable Function

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to maximize the mathematical function f(x)\=xâ‹…sin(x). The code is written in JavaScript and showcases key principles of genetic algorithms, including initialization, selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation.
